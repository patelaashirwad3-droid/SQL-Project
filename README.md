# ðŸ“šOnline Library Management System â€“ SQL Project
## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

The Library Management System was designed to efficiently manage books, users, and borrowing records while ensuring smooth operations for both library staff and members. This project involved:

Creating a relational database schema.

Inserting realistic sample data.

Defining Primary Keys and Foreign Keys to maintain data integrity.

Writing SQL queries to answer real-world business questions such as book availability, overdue tracking, fines, and borrowing trends.

## ðŸ”¹ Database Design

The system follows a normalized relational schema built using Primary Keys and Foreign Keys for interconnectivity.

## ðŸ”¹ Data Insertion

Inserted 10 rows in each table.

User roles included Students, Faculty, and Staff.

Authors and Publishers represented a variety of book categories.

Books were linked to Authors and Publishers using foreign keys.

BookCopies maintained Available/Issued status.

IssueRecords included realistic borrowing scenarios, with on-time and overdue returns generating fines.

## ðŸ”¹ Business Impact & Insights

Operational Efficiency: Helped track book availability and manage overdue returns.

Revenue Optimization: Enabled calculation of fine collections per month.

User Behavior Analysis: Identified top readers and frequent late returners.

Strategic Acquisition: Found popular authors & publishers to guide new book purchases.

Trend Analysis: Borrowing patterns across months and years allowed the library to optimize staffing and stock levels.

### âœ… This project demonstrates database schema design, data modeling (Snowflake Schema-like), SQL constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key), and real-world analytical query solving.
